# CycleCo Business Performance Dashboard

I'm excited to share my latest end-to-end data analytics project — the **CycleCo Business Performance Dashboard** — built to analyze sales, revenue, inventory, and service trends.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** → extracting and querying raw business data
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Power BI** → interactive visualization and dashboard design
- **Canva & PowerPoint** → preparing visuals and presentation materials

## My Process

- Extracted raw data from SQL databases.
- Cleaned and filtered datasets in Python to handle missing and inconsistent values.
- Performed EDA to discover patterns and trends using Pandas and NumPy.
- Designed and developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to showcase insights.

## Challenges & How I Solved Them

- **Missing Data Handling:**  
  During EDA, I encountered errors due to several null and blank values. Initially, removing them caused significant data loss. Instead, I refined my cleaning approach to handle missing values without losing critical information.

- **Conditional Colors in Slicer:**  
  I initially tried to apply conditional colors directly in a slicer for status values in Power BI, but it wasn't supported. I solved this by switching to a table visual where I could apply color formatting effectively.

- **Choosing the Right Visuals:**  
  I struggled to decide which charts best visualized the insights. Through experimentation and feedback, I arrived at the best combination of visuals to tell the data story clearly.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

✅ Interactive slicers for Service Type, Cycle Type, and Status  
✅ Conditional formatting for visual clarity and quick insights  
✅ KPIs displaying total status count, average rating, and tasks completed  
✅ Charts showing monthly sales, revenue, and unit trends  
✅ Clean, modern design with custom color themes

## What I Gained

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- SQL querying and data extraction
- Data analysis and EDA in Python
- Data modeling and DAX in Power BI
- Visual storytelling and dashboard design
- Creative problem-solving for Power BI limitations
- Preparing impactful presentations with PowerPoint and Canva

I'm looking forward to exploring more data-driven insights and sharing future projects!
